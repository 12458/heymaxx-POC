# Overview

Your boss storms into your room, eyes wide with a mix of panic and determination, and shouts, "God bless us, we only have five hours to put this thing online!!" The urgency in his voice sends a clear message: failure is not an option. You're tasked with creating a full-stack e-commerce application, and the clock is ticking.

Here's the scenario: A local artisanal shop, known for its unique, handcrafted items, has been hit hard by recent events. To survive, they need to move their business online, fast. They've turned to your company for help. Your mission is to build an e-commerce platform that allows users to:

- [x] Item Catalog: Create a catalog of items that includes at least 10 different items, each with a unique name, description, and price. 
- [x] Shopping Cart: Implement a shopping cart that allows users to add items from the item catalog. The shopping cart should keep track of the quantity of each item. 
- [x] Add/Remove Items: Users should be able to add items to and remove items from the shopping cart. 
- [x] Checkout Process: Implement a checkout process that includes user information, shipping address, and payment method (just mock the actual payment)
